# Eat Da Sequel Burger!

## Overview

A Node.js/Express/MySQL/Sequelize/Handlebars app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat... and then devour them!

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it after choosing they way it is cooked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.This app uses the Sequelize ORM rather than raw MySQL queries. And, using Sequelize, the app is now relational, tracking which users ate which burger.
